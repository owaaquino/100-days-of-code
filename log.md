# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Preparation. Setting up my copy of 100DaysOfCode repository.

**Thoughts:** Its been a while since I last use Git, it just mean that I really have problem on my productivity. I joined the 100DayOfCode challenge today for  React.. I want to learn React.js and widen my knowledge on Javascript.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
