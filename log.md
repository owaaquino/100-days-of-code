# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Another TODOLIST App. First React project is to create a To Do App.

**Thoughts:**  The never ending to do list app because.. why not? I think it teaches you the basic structure of C.R.U.D for React.

**What I've Learned Today:**
1. React requires you to start your components name in Uppercase.

### Day 0: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Preparation. Setting up my copy of 100DaysOfCode repository.

**Thoughts:**  Joined the 100DayOfCode challenge today for React.js, I wanted to learn React.js and widen my knowledge on Javascript using this framework. I'll set monthly goals so that I can track my progress.

<!-- ### Day 0: August 2, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
